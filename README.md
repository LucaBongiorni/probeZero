Probe Zero, a security oriented embedded system
===============================================

* based on Raspberry Pi Zero
* relies on last version of Node.js
* case and top designed with OpenSCAD (STL files also available)
* no SD card image release yet (maybe later)

Tracking devices and people
---------------------------

I provide the code I used to fingerprint, classify and track devices. It is mainly based
(again) on *Noble.js*, in the *tracking-ble* folder.

I also provide a signed APK in *tracking-android-app*, along with complete source code (Proof of Concept, may be dirty).
